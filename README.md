🚀 My React Portfolio Project
Hey there! 👋
This is a personal project I built using Create React App. I'm currently a student, learning React and building cool stuff as I go. This portfolio is a fun way to practice what I've been learning and show off some of my work.


🛠 Getting Started

Once that's sorted, open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anuvesh07/Portfolio.git
cd Portfolio
npm install
npm start
```
This will start the app in development mode.
Visit http://localhost:3000 to see it in action!


📜 Available Scripts
Inside the project folder, you can use these commands:

npm start
Starts the app in development mode.
It’ll reload automatically when you make changes (super helpful when you're tweaking stuff). You can also spot any errors directly in the console.

npm test
This runs the test watcher in interactive mode.
Still learning testing properly — but hey, it's a start!
More info here.

npm run build
Bundles the app for production — this is what you’d deploy somewhere like GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.
It optimizes everything for performance and gives you a neat build/ folder.

npm run eject
Okay, warning time ⚠️
This command gives you full control over the config (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), but it’s irreversible. I haven’t needed it yet, but it’s good to know it’s there.

📚 Learning Resources
I’m using a lot of these to learn React and improve my skills:

React Docs

Create React App Docs

They’re super helpful, especially when you’re just starting out.

🔍 Extras (If you're curious)
Code Splitting

Analyzing the Bundle Size

Making a Progressive Web App

Advanced Configuration

Deployment

Troubleshooting Build Errors

Thanks for checking out my project! If you have feedback or ideas, feel free to open an issue or just say hi 😄
